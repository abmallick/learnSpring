# This repository maintains the code for my path on learning Spring, Hibernate and Maven
To learn these technologies, I'm implementing a dummy Online Clinic System
There are 3 actors in the implementation: Admin, Patient and Doctor

# Roles of the Doctor
1) To add or remove a user (user can be a new dcotor, patient or a admin)
2) To confirm schedule appointment
  2.1) The admin gets a list of all the doctors with their specialization
  2.2) The admin gets a list of all the patients with their ailment details and the patient's preferred date
  2.3) Based on these criteria the doctor schedules the appointment
